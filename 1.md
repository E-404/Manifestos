# 1. Manifest to disable communication with servers that have untrusted certificates

In the past, the certificates were worth the money. In the past, obtaining certificates was a difficult task.This forced the use of self-signed certificates in self-signed connections to preserve the federation.

Currently, certificates have become free and anyone can get them. We believe that the time has come to stop supporting self-signed certificates to increase user security.

Default Settings Allow Self-Signed Certificates. We intend to stop using untrusted certificates!

[Manual for operators XMPP servers](https://github.com/E-404/Manifestos/blob/master/1.md#setup-instructions)


## Servers in this list pledge not to accept connections with self-signed certificates.

- [404.city](https://404.city)
- [jabberon.ru](https://jabberon.ru)


## Servers in this list refused to support the manifest

Servers that fail to verify certificates in cross-server connections

## Servers violated the execution of the manifest

Servers that accepted the manifest, but did not use it


## Setup Instructions


**Warning! (leave the defaults config list CIPHERS alone)** Remember the correct cipher list, otherwise you will not be able to connect to the servers. Do not try to enumerate ciphers yourself, because certificates can be used in the future by other ciphers

**Correct (example for Ejabberd):**
```
'TLS_CIPHERS': "HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:@STRENGTH"
```
**Wrong: (example for Ejabberd)**
 ```
 'TLS_CIPHERS': "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA"

 ```
This set includes **ECC (ECDHE-ECDSA) and RSA (ECDHE-RSA)** ciphers. This is right now, but will not work in the future!
In the future, new ciphers will appear and the setting will be incorrect. To upgrade the certificate class, use the ECC certificate instead of RSA, and not guessing with cipher suites!

 
**Ejabberd (ejabberd.yml)**
```
s2s_use_starttls: required
```
Change to
```
s2s_use_starttls: required_trusted
```
**Prosody**

```
s2s_secure_auth = false
```
Change to
```
s2s_secure_auth = true
```
