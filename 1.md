# 1. Manifest to disable communication with servers that have untrusted certificates

In the past, the certificates were worth the money. In the past, obtaining certificates was a difficult task.This forced the use of self-signed certificates in self-signed connections to preserve the federation.

Currently, certificates have become free and anyone can get them. We believe that the time has come to stop supporting self-signed certificates to increase user security.

Default settings Ejabberd and Prosody allow self-signed certificates:

**Ejabberd:**
```
s2s_use_starttls: required

```
**Prosody**
```
s2s_secure_auth = false
```
We intend to stop using untrusted certificates! [Manual for operators XMPP servers](https://github.com/E-404/Manifestos/blob/master/1.md#setup-instructions)


## Servers in this list pledge not to accept connections with self-signed certificates.

- [404.city](https://404.city)
- [jabberon.ru](https://jabberon.ru)


## Servers in this list refused to support the manifest

Servers that fail to verify certificates in cross-server connections

## Servers violated the execution of the manifest

Servers that accepted the manifest, but did not use it


## Setup Instructions


### Warning! Notices! Leave the defaults s2s list ciphers alone! 


**Correct default (example for Ejabberd):**
```
'TLS_CIPHERS': "HIGH:!aNULL:!eNULL:!3DES:@STRENGTH"
```
**Wrong modification: (example for Ejabberd)**
 ```
 'TLS_CIPHERS': "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CAMELLIA256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA"

 ```
**Notices:** Many administrators are trying to upgrade the certificate class by manually listing the ciphers - this is wrong.
This set includes **ECC (ECDHE-ECDSA) and RSA (ECDHE-RSA)** ciphers. This is right now, but will not work in the future!In the future, new ciphers will appear and the setting will be incorrect. **To upgrade the certificate class, use the ECC certificate** instead of RSA, and not guessing with cipher list!



**Ejabberd (ejabberd.yml)**
```
s2s_use_starttls: required
```
Change to
```
s2s_use_starttls: required_trusted
```
**Prosody**

```
s2s_secure_auth = false
```
Change to
```
s2s_secure_auth = true
```
