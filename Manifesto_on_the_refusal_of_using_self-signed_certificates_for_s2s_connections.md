In the past, the certificates were worth the money. In the past, obtaining certificates was a difficult task.This forced the use of self-signed certificates in self-signed connections to preserve the federation.

Currently, certificates have become free and anyone can get them. We believe that the time has come to stop supporting self-signed certificates to increase user security.
